First half is very slow and boring,0
"Songs are the best part of movie, I liked it",1
I didn’t liked it.,0
"I will give it a big zero, what a waste",0
Total overacting by the leads,0
No doubt. This film is the changing phase for Sandalwood industry. Each and every people have put seeminglessly a hard work and effort.,1
The best of all Indian movies.Nothing can be compared to this.,1
Race is known for his suspenses and thriller..which was missing in this film.,0
"#Fresh Story ,Great Visuals,best part is there are too many characters in the film which really increases the curiosity of the audience and proves that the Hero is not the only powerful character in the movie else the movie would become too predictable like any other Bollywood masala movie...",1
Worst movie of the Race franchise. It's an all-out Salman Khan Show. i am giving 2 star out of 5.,0
A very illogical action sequences as usual.,0
"Remarkable direction, outstanding acting, monumental narration, unthinkable screenplay, striking action sequences",1
"Meaningless, in appropriate, boring!!!",0
Race 3 is undoubtedly one of the worst big budget commercial movies I've seen in a while,0
This was 3rd class acting from top class actors. I was extremely disappointed,0
This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. It's so boring and illogical,0
An epic milestone in Kannada industry!! I am now proud to say that I belong to the place where all the technicians of this film belong to i.e. Karnataka....,1
"Fabulous work done by prashant neel,we can't get bored while watching this movie! Screenplay, Bgm, cinematography amazing! Big thanks for Ravi basruru!bhuvan gowda and rest of the crew",1
KGF is a win for the whole Kannada film industry.,1
"Even the characters or the performances didn't elevate the film. Salman Khan walked, talked and acted like a robot.",0
"One does not go to watch the race franchise for brilliant story line or acting. But, this movie is ridiculous. Aao twist karen was a song the writer took to heart I guess",0
There's a twist a minute and frankly the twists gave me a neck pain,0
Cinematography is mindblowing. The depiction of the Kolar Gold Fields is so stunning that you'll have a tough time finding an excuse for not watching it on the big screen,1
"Its a fantastic experience unlike the same formulaic style being routine love story, unnecessary heroine who dont hold any value or support for story but being idle just being for the sake of hero or other routine aspects which I even feel unworthy to mention.",1
superb flop movie i ever seen in my life loser's leader salman khan,0
"only stunt is not important acting is also required, people are not foolish every movie can watch, saif ali khan 100 time batter then salman.",0
This movie is a very horrible and a worst movie. I dont like this Race. I like previous Race better like Race 1 and Race 2. Those type of movies very silly.,0
Salman Khan acted very bad in that movie and the songs and dance were so bad. Even the thriller or action was very bad. This movie does not have any reviews or story.,0
"Game Changer, Mass Cinematic Brilliance 4 Star",1
It was a mind-blowing experience to watch such masterpiece and that too in other language. Usually south movies are dubbed so poorly that it looses the basic charm of it but here in KGF this turned out to be the best where movie wasn't dubbed but actually all the dialogues were rewritten beautifully to make it an engaging experience.,1
"t has some punchlines like"" If you think you are bad, I am your dad"" which KGF fans like me love the most. The Mother bgm is just awesome. Whenever the Mother bgm plays, it gives me goosebumps.The movie revolves around mainly Rocky and KGF : Kolar Gold Fields.",1
"I don't know why salman think that he can do everything, lyricist, acting, singing, producing. He need to focus on his acting rather than all things. And the most important thing to do is break his image of dabang bcoz last many years he is doing same zonor movie.. Now people gets irritated bcoz koi kitna sahega bhaigiri.",0
"This movie is a masterpiece with a unique story and world that it transports the audience to. The only drawback of this movie is choppy edits and scenes cutting fast within 1-2 seconds otherwise the acting, emotion, storyline, direction, screenplay and BGM are absolutely stunning for this movie.",1
This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. It's so boring and illogical that you will try to attempt suicide in the theater itself. Such an illogical and over-hyped movie.,0
ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING POWERFUL MOVIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED.....,1
"They should have left it at the Second installment. This installment just is a disaster from the get go ... plot holes ..weak narrative and icing on cake deplorable acting rather droning on especially by Daisy,Saquib and Bobby. Not sure why they cast Daisy Shah (obnoxious and nasal). Music is subpar.",0
"Excellent Story, screen play, direction, cinematography, dialogues, lyrics,music, background score, and performances.",1
Very very flop movie. There is nothing like race in if. Saif Ali khan was the best in every race. It's a request to Rohit Shetty that please direct race 4,0
"The best Indian action film, the way story is built, screen play and dialogues are absolutely brilliant.",1
"this movie is one of my favorites, yash gave his best performance in this movie i loved his look and style in this movie alotttt.",1
"The plot twist were so unnecessary , and this movie had more than 2 and still it was super boring.",0
It is the best movie I have ever seen in India in my entire life. The storyline was great and the character build-up was very clear and nice,1
This movie is a very horrible and a worst movie. I dont like this Race. I like previous Race better like Race 1 and Race 2.,0
